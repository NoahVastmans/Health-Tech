# ðŸ§± Prototype Sensor Case
3D design files for the protective casing used to house the electronics inside a tennis ball.
The case ensures durability while maintaining balance.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This folder contains all **cad design resources** for the SmartServe Ball project.  
The 3D printed case is design to work with the first version of the SmartServe Ball as described in **electrical design resources**.

## ðŸ§  Design Notes

- The sensor case serves purpose as a **proof of concept** for rapid prototyping.
- It is designed to be manufactured in a **3D printing machine** under the material of **Polyurethane (PTU)**.
  -  Flexibility and Elasticity
  -  Tensile Strength
  -  Impact Resistance
  -  Tear Resistance
- Tailormade designed to the specific dimensions of the SmartServe Ball.
- Design pivots from the manufacturing process of a tennis ball.
- The **sensor case itself was not tested** by any FEA system or physical examination.

## ðŸ”Œ Implementation Overview

The assembly image illustrates: 
- **Tennis Ball Outer Felt layer** 6cm diameter  
- **Tennis Ball Inner Rubber Core** 3mm thick
- **Sensor case prototype**
- **SmartServe Ball sensor system**

## ðŸ§° Tools

- **Any CAD design software** (for viewing and editing files)  
- **SolidWorks** (original CAD designed software use)

Consideration when opening the part:
1. Model uses external reference of the components of the SmartServe Ball.  
2. Therefore, to use in other systems.
  a. External references may need to be broken.
  b. Adjust contour sketches to match the components' dimensions.
