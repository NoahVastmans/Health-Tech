## ðŸ§  Design Notes

- Only the **schematic** was designed digitally in KiCad.  
- The **PCB itself was not routed** in KiCad or fabricated.

Instead, an **adaptable prototyping PCB** was used for greater flexibility:
- Components were mounted on **both sides** of the board.  
- Components were mounted on top of each other to save space.  
- This approach allowed **rapid iteration** and **easy modification** during testing and validation.

## ðŸ”Œ Connection Overview

The schematic illustrates: 
- **Power lines** (`3.3V` and `GND`) shared between all components  
- **Digital output pin (D5)** used to drive the **buzzer** for apex and event feedback

---

## ðŸ§° Tools

- **KiCad 7.x or later** (for viewing and editing schematic files)  
- **Seeeduino XIAO KICAD Library** (included in this folder)

To open the schematic correctly:
1. Ensure the `Seeeduino XIAO KICAD/` folder is in the same directory as the `.kicad_pro` file.  
2. Open `SmartServeBall.kicad_pro` in KiCad.  
3. Verify that component symbols and footprints load without errors.

## ðŸ§± Assembly Process

The assembly was performed in several structured steps to create a compact and robust sensor module:

1. **Top Layer Soldering:**  
   The first layer of components was soldered on the **upper side** of the adaptable PCB.  
   This included the **buzzer**, **resistor**, and **pin extensions** for the Seeed XIAO BLE Sense.

2. **Power Wiring:**  
   Next, the **power supply wires** were soldered to the corresponding **3.3V** and **GND** pins, ensuring solid electrical contact and mechanical stability.

3. **Base Layer Protection:**  
   After soldering the lower connections, a **thin layer of hot glue** was applied to the **bottom side** of the PCB to insulate and protect the solder joints.

4. **Battery Holder Placement:**  
   The **battery holder** was then positioned directly on top of the glued surface, forming the **second hardware layer** of the design.

5. **Final Power Connection:**  
   Finally, the **power wires** were soldered to the **battery holder terminals**, completing the electrical circuit and enabling portable operation.

This stacked-layer assembly provided an **efficient use of space** and **robust wiring**, allowing the electronics to fit neatly inside the SmartServe Ballâ€™s protective enclosure.
